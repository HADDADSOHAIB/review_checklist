         > Then apply 3 simple rules from this lesson (it will be easy as you can use a template provided there).
         > This Code Review Request will be marked as invalid in your Dashboard, so please submit a new one once you are ready!
    - **report Code Review Request as invalid if these conditions are not met**
- [ ] Verify correct use of the Github Flow or Git Flow [[more]](./03_flows.md) as requested [here](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/66250306/) and [here](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/59882084/)
